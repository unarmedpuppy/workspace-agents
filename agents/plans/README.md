# workflow-agents - Plans

This directory contains implementation plans with embedded task checklists for tracking work.

## What are Plans?

**Plans** document how to implement features, fix bugs, or refactor code. Each plan:

- **Defines** requirements and scope
- **Breaks down** work into phased checklists
- **Tracks** progress with embedded tasks
- **Documents** decisions and test strategies

## Directory Structure

## Creating New Plans

Use the `plan-creator` skill:

```bash
cd agents/skills/plan-creator
npm run create
```

See [../skills/plan-creator/](../skills/plan-creator/) for full documentation.

### Plan Types

| Type | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Feature** | New functionality | Adding capabilities, implementing features |
| **Bug Fix** | Defect resolution | Fixing issues, resolving problems |
| **Refactor** | Code restructuring | Improving design, reducing tech debt |

### Plan Template

```markdown
---
title: Feature Name
created: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft
author: @agent-id
type: feature
---

# Plan: Feature Name

## Objective

Clear goal statement.

## Requirements

- What must be implemented
- User-facing behavior

## Out of Scope

- Explicit boundaries
- What we're NOT doing

## Current State

### Existing Code
- Relevant files and their purpose

### Dependencies
- Required packages or changes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

### Phase 2: Core Features
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Task 4

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Task 5
- [ ] Task 6

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests
- What to test

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end scenarios

## Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update relevant docs
```

## Plan Lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Initial planning, not yet started |
| `in-progress` | Active implementation |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependencies |
| `completed` | Fully implemented and tested |

Update the YAML frontmatter as work progresses:

```yaml
---
title: Feature Name
status: in-progress
started: 2025-01-15
progress: 6/14 tasks complete
---
```

## Committed vs Local Plans

**Committed Plans** (`plans/`):
- Shared across the team
- Version controlled
- Multi-session work
- Example: Feature implementations, major refactors

**Local Plans** (`plans/local/`):
- Gitignored scratch work
- Personal session notes
- Exploratory analysis
- Example: "What if we tried X?"

## Plans vs Other Resources

**Plans** (this directory):
- Implementation tracking with embedded tasks
- Evolve during implementation
- Have lifecycle (draft → in-progress → completed)
- Example: "Plan for adding user authentication"

**Reference docs** (`../reference/`):
- Deep documentation on topics
- Relatively static
- No task tracking
- Example: "How authentication works in this codebase"

**Personas** (`../personas/`):
- Agent personalities and expertise
- Guide how to approach work
- Example: "Security-focused agent reviews auth plans"

**Skills** (`../skills/`):
- Executable actions
- Create/validate/package artifacts
- Example: "Create a new plan from template"

## Best Practices

- **Plan first** for non-trivial work
- **Be specific** - vague plans lead to confusion
- **Break into phases** - large features need structure
- **Document decisions** - record why choices were made
- **Update as you go** - plans evolve during implementation
- **Mark tasks complete** immediately when done
