# Legacy Directory

Archive for deprecated patterns and migration artifacts.

## Purpose

Store files that don't fit the current framework structure but may have historical value.

## What Goes Here

- Deprecated documentation
- Migration reports
- Old patterns that were replaced
- Archived scripts

## Organization

Preserve original paths when moving files to legacy:

```
legacy/
├── README.md (this file)
└── archived-date/
    └── original/path/file.md
```

## When to Archive

- Pattern replaced by better approach
- Documentation no longer relevant
- Code migrated to new structure
- Historical reference needed
