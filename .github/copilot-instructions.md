# Project Instructions

This project uses a shared documentation structure across AI assistants.

## Entry Point

See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for the primary project documentation.

## Quick Reference

**Most Critical Rules:**

- Keep AGENTS.md concise (<300 lines); move details to `agents/reference/`
- Use YAML frontmatter for tool/persona/plan discovery
- Follow the task claiming protocol in `agents/plans/tasks.md`
- Commit local scratch work to `agents/plans/local/` (gitignored)
- Always test documentation by reading as an AI agent would

## Custom Agents

Custom agents are available in `.github/agents/`:

| Agent | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| _(none yet)_ | Custom agents can be added here for specialized tasks |
