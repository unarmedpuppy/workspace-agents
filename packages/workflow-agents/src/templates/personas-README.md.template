# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Personas

This directory contains reusable agent personalities that provide contextual guidance for AI assistants.

## What are Personas?

**Personas** provide behavioral guidance and workflow orchestration for AI agents. Unlike skills (which are executable), personas describe:

- **When** to use certain skills
- **How** to approach specific types of work
- **What** patterns and standards to follow
- **Why** certain decisions are made

## Available Personas

| Persona | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `documentation-agent.md` | Maintains documentation quality and standards |
| `framework-agent.md` | Framework development and architecture patterns |
| `meta-agent.md` | Meta-level project guidance and coordination |

## Creating Custom Personas

1. Create a new `.md` file in this directory
2. Add YAML frontmatter with name, description, and skills-used
3. Document the persona's role, approach, and patterns
4. Link to relevant skills and reference documentation

### Template

```markdown
---
name: persona-name
description: What this persona does and when to invoke it
skills-used:
  - skill-name-1
  - skill-name-2
---

# Persona Name

## Role

What this persona is responsible for.

## When to Invoke

## Patterns

Best practices specific to this persona's domain.
```

## Personas vs Skills

**Skills** (`../skills/`):
- Executable, deterministic actions
- "DO things" - create files, validate, package
- Invoked directly via scripts
- Example: `skill-creator/scripts/validate.js`

**Personas** (this directory):
- Contextual guidance and orchestration
- "GUIDE how and when" to use skills
- Read by agents for behavioral context
- Example: "documentation-agent knows when to validate docs"

**Relationship**: Personas orchestrate skills. A persona says "in this context, use these skills in this order."
