# Plan → Act → Test Workflow

Complete workflow guide for AI-assisted development in {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

## Overview

The Plan → Act → Test workflow provides structure for feature development while maintaining code quality and preventing rework.

```
┌─────────┐
│  PLAN   │ → Understand requirements, explore code, create implementation plan
└────┬────┘
     │
┌────▼────┐
│   ACT   │ → Implement incrementally, commit often, follow patterns
└────┬────┘
     │
┌────▼────┐
│  TEST   │ → Verify correctness, run tests, update docs, create PR
└─────────┘
```

## Plan Storage

- **`agents/plans/`** - Committed plans for multi-session work
- **`agents/plans/local/`** - Gitignored scratch work, session notes

## Creating Plans

Use the plan-creator skill if available:

```bash
cd agents/skills/plan-creator
npm run create
```

Or create manually following this template:

```markdown
---
title: Feature/Fix Name
created: YYYY-MM-DD
status: draft
type: feature|bug-fix|refactor
---

# Plan: Feature Name

## Objective
[Clear goal statement]

## Requirements
- Requirement 1
- Requirement 2

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Test Strategy
[How to verify correctness]
```

## Plan → Act → Test Cycle

### Plan Phase

1. **Understand requirements** - What problem are we solving?
2. **Explore codebase** - How is similar functionality implemented?
3. **Ask questions** - Resolve ambiguity before coding
4. **Create plan** - Break into actionable tasks
5. **Define tests** - How will we verify success?

### Act Phase

1. **Create branch** - `git checkout -b feature/description`
2. **Implement incrementally** - One task at a time
3. **Commit often** - Small, focused commits
4. **Test continuously** - Verify as you go
5. **Update plan** - Check off completed tasks

### Test Phase

1. **Run tests** - Full test suite passes
2. **Manual testing** - Verify end-to-end
3. **Update docs** - Keep documentation current
4. **Code review** - Request review if needed
5. **Mark complete** - Update task status

## Task Claiming

See `agents/plans/tasks.md` for available work.

**Protocol**:
1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
2. Edit task frontmatter: `claimed_by: @your-id`
3. Commit and push
4. Create feature branch

## Best Practices

- **Plan first** for non-trivial work
- **Commit often** with clear messages
- **Test continuously** to catch issues early
- **Ask questions** before making assumptions
- **Update documentation** as you go

## Templates

### Feature Plan

Use for new functionality and capabilities.

### Bug Fix Plan

Use for defects and issues.

### Refactor Plan

Use for code restructuring and tech debt.

See plan-creator skill for complete templates.
