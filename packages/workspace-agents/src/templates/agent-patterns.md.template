# Agent Patterns

Best practices for working with AI agents in this project.

## Core Principles

### Progressive Disclosure

Structure documentation from general to specific:
1. **AGENTS.md** - High-level overview and entry point
2. **agents/reference/** - Topic-focused deep dives
3. **Skill SKILL.md** - Specific tool documentation

### Single Source of Truth

- Don't duplicate information across files
- Use links to reference authoritative sources
- Update in one place, link from many

### Agent-Readable Format

- Clear headings and structure
- Concrete examples
- Explicit boundaries (Always Do, Ask First, Never Do)
- Actionable instructions in imperative form

## Workflow Patterns

### Plan → Act → Test

See `agents/reference/plan_act.md` for complete workflow.

**Planning**: Create implementation plan before coding
**Acting**: Implement incrementally with frequent commits
**Testing**: Verify before marking tasks complete

## Communication Patterns

### Asking Questions

When uncertain:
- Ask before assuming
- Provide context
- Suggest options when possible
- Document answers in plan or code

### Reporting Progress

- Update task status regularly
- Commit incrementally
- Document blockers immediately
- Communicate breaking changes

## File Organization

### Naming Conventions

- **Files**: `kebab-case.md`
- **Skills**: `hyphen-case` (matches directory)
- **Branches**: `feature/description`, `fix/description`

### Directory Structure

Follow the established structure:
- `agents/reference/` for documentation
- `agents/skills/` for executable tools
- `agents/plans/` for implementation plans
- `agents/personas/` for agent personalities

## Error Handling

### When Things Go Wrong

1. Document the error
2. Check similar patterns
3. Ask for clarification if needed
4. Update documentation to prevent recurrence

### Rollback Strategy

- Keep changes small and atomic
- Commit frequently
- Feature branches prevent main contamination
- Git history enables easy rollback

## Best Practices

- **Read first**: Check AGENTS.md and relevant docs before starting
- **Plan ahead**: Create a plan for non-trivial work
- **Commit often**: Small, focused commits
- **Test continuously**: Verify as you go
- **Document decisions**: Record why, not just what
- **Ask questions**: Better to ask than assume wrong
