**Using agents/**:
- **plans/**: Create plans here for multi-step work. Commit when sharing across sessions.
- **plans/local/**: Ephemeral scratch work. Never committed. Use for exploration.
- **reference/**: Topic documentation. Load only when relevant to current task.
- **skills/**: Use `/skill <name>` to invoke. See [agents/README.md](agents/README.md) for list.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Lint passes with no warnings
- [ ] No TODO comments left in changed code
- [ ] Documentation updated for any API changes
- [ ] PR description explains the "why"

## Anti-Goals

**Do not modify** (unless explicitly asked):
- [Legacy code in `src/legacy/`]
- [Database migration files]
- [Generated files in `dist/`]
- [Third-party integrations]

**Do not refactor**:
- Working code unrelated to the current task
- Test utilities unless tests are failing
- Build configuration
