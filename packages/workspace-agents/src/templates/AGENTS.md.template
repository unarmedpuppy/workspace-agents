## Code Style

[Add your code style guidelines here]

See `agents/reference/documentation-style.md` for complete guidelines.

## Boundaries

### Always Do
- Update task status when claiming/completing work (see `agents/plans/tasks.md`)
- Keep AGENTS.md concise; move deep docs to `agents/reference/`
- Use YAML frontmatter for discoverable resources
- Test documentation changes by reading as an AI agent would
- Commit after each logical update

### Ask First
- Major architectural changes
- New dependencies or frameworks
- Breaking changes to APIs
- Adding new top-level directories

### Never Do
- Commit to main branch directly (use feature branches)
- Delete documented patterns without archiving
- Skip updating the README when adding new features
- Commit ephemeral work from `agents/plans/local/`

## Workflow

### Plan → Act → Test

1. **Plan**: Understand requirements, explore existing code, ask clarifying questions
2. **Act**: Implement incrementally, commit often, follow patterns
3. **Test**: Verify correctness, run tests, update docs

### Planning Documentation

Store plans in `agents/plans/` (shared) or `agents/plans/local/` (local only):

- **`agents/plans/`** - Committed plans for multi-session work
- **`agents/plans/local/`** - Gitignored scratch work, session notes

See `agents/reference/plan_act.md` for plan templates and workflow details.

### Task Claiming (Multi-Agent)

See `agents/plans/tasks.md` for available work. Protocol:

1. Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
2. Edit `agents/plans/tasks.md` - update frontmatter: `claimed_by: @your-id`
3. Commit and push within 1 minute
4. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/task-description`

## Skills Documentation

Agent-discoverable skills are in `agents/skills/`:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [skill-creator](agents/skills/skill-creator/) | Create new Anthropic-compliant skills |
| [plan-creator](agents/skills/plan-creator/) | Create implementation plans |
| [persona-creator](agents/skills/persona-creator/) | Create domain-specific personas |
| [reference-creator](agents/skills/reference-creator/) | Create reference documentation |

Each skill contains:
- `SKILL.md` - Documentation with YAML frontmatter
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `scripts/` - Executable implementations

> **IMPORTANT**: When creating new skills, plans, personas, or reference docs, **always use the corresponding creator skill**. This ensures consistent formatting and structure across the framework. Run the skill via `/skill <name>` or `npm run create` in the skill directory.

## Deep-Dive Documentation

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `agents/README.md` | Directory index explaining all subdirectories |
| `agents/reference/` | Topic-focused deep documentation |
| `agents/plans/tasks.md` | Task list, claiming protocol, status |
| `agents/plans/` | Shared implementation plans (committed) |
| `agents/plans/local/` | Local scratch work (gitignored) |
| `agents/personas/` | Reusable agent personalities |
| `agents/skills/` | Executable skills with YAML frontmatter |
