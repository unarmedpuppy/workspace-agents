# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Personas

This directory contains reusable agent personalities that provide contextual guidance for AI assistants.

## What are Personas?

**Personas** provide behavioral guidance and workflow orchestration for AI agents. Unlike skills (which are executable), personas describe:

- **When** to use certain skills
- **How** to approach specific types of work
- **What** patterns and standards to follow
- **Why** certain decisions are made

## Available Personas

| Persona | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| [workspace-builder.md](workspace-builder.md) | **Run first!** Comprehensive onboarding that customizes the framework to your project |
| [documentation-agent.md](documentation-agent.md) | Maintains documentation quality and standards compliance |
| [framework-agent.md](framework-agent.md) | Workspace Agents framework specialist and best practices |

## Getting Started

After scaffolding, invoke the workspace-builder persona to customize everything:

```
@workspace-builder Please analyze this codebase and customize the framework
```

This will:
1. Analyze your codebase structure and tech stack
2. Update AGENTS.md with real project information
3. Create relevant reference documents
4. Build a development-agent.md with full codebase expertise
5. Create implementation plans with discovered recommendations

## Creating New Personas

Use the `persona-creator` skill:

```bash
cd agents/skills/persona-creator
npm run create
```

See [../skills/persona-creator/](../skills/persona-creator/) for full documentation.

## Personas vs Skills

**Skills** (`../skills/`):
- Executable, deterministic actions
- "DO things" - create files, validate, package
- Invoked directly via scripts
- Example: `skill-creator/scripts/validate.js`

**Personas** (this directory):
- Contextual guidance and orchestration
- "GUIDE how and when" to use skills
- Read by agents for behavioral context
- Example: "documentation-agent knows when to validate docs"

**Relationship**: Personas orchestrate skills. A persona says "in this context, use these skills in this order."
