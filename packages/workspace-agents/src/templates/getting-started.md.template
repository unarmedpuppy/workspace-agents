# Getting Started with {{PROJECT_NAME}} Agent Workspace

This guide walks you through customizing your scaffolded workspace to make it truly useful for your project.

## Quick Start

Run this command in a new AI session:

```
@workspace-builder enhance my workspace
```

The workspace-builder persona will analyze your codebase and customize everything automatically.

## What You Have

After scaffolding, your project contains:

```
{{PROJECT_NAME}}/
├── AGENTS.md                    # Universal agent entrypoint (customize this!)
├── CLAUDE.md                    # Claude Code breadcrumb → AGENTS.md
├── GEMINI.md                    # Gemini breadcrumb → AGENTS.md
├── .cursor/rules/               # Cursor breadcrumb
├── .github/copilot-instructions.md  # Copilot breadcrumb
├── .claude/skills/              # Symlinks to your skills
└── agents/
    ├── reference/               # Topic documentation
    ├── plans/                   # Implementation plans (with embedded tasks)
    │   ├── local/               # Local scratch (gitignored)
    │   └── getting-started.md   # This file
    ├── personas/                # Agent behaviors
    │   ├── workspace-builder.md # Run first!
    │   ├── documentation-agent.md
    │   └── framework-agent.md
    └── skills/                  # Executable skills
        ├── skill-creator/
        ├── plan-creator/
        └── persona-creator/
```

## Customization Plan

### Phase 1: Run Workspace Builder

**Goal**: Transform generic templates into project-specific documentation.

- [ ] Start a new AI session
- [ ] Invoke: `@workspace-builder enhance my workspace`
- [ ] Review the changes workspace-builder makes
- [ ] Commit the customized files

**What workspace-builder does**:
1. Analyzes your codebase structure and tech stack
2. Updates AGENTS.md with real project information
3. Creates relevant reference documents
4. Builds a development-agent.md persona
5. Creates improvement plans with recommendations

### Phase 2: Customize AGENTS.md

**Goal**: Make AGENTS.md the authoritative guide for AI agents working on your project.

- [ ] Review the Project Summary section - is it accurate?
- [ ] Verify Tech Stack is complete
- [ ] Update Quick Start commands
- [ ] Add project-specific Architecture Overview
- [ ] Document your Code Style conventions
- [ ] Define Boundaries (Allowed Operations / Forbidden / Anti-Goals)

**Key principle**: AGENTS.md should be <300 lines. Move detailed docs to `agents/reference/`.

### Phase 3: Create Project-Specific Personas

**Goal**: Build specialized agents for your common workflows.

Use `/skill persona-creator` or create manually in `agents/personas/`.

**Consider creating personas for**:

| Persona | When to Create |
|---------|----------------|
| `development-agent.md` | Your main coding assistant (workspace-builder creates this) |
| `testing-agent.md` | Complex testing requirements |
| `api-agent.md` | API design and implementation |
| `database-agent.md` | Database/ORM expertise |
| `security-agent.md` | Security-sensitive codebase |
| `devops-agent.md` | CI/CD and deployment |
| `[framework]-agent.md` | Framework-specific guidance (react-agent, django-agent) |

**Persona checklist**:
- [ ] Identify 2-3 common workflows that need specialized guidance
- [ ] Create personas using `/skill persona-creator`
- [ ] Include key files the persona should know
- [ ] Document patterns and anti-patterns
- [ ] Add "when to invoke" scenarios

### Phase 4: Create Reference Documentation

**Goal**: Document knowledge that doesn't fit in personas or skills.

Reference docs live in `agents/reference/` and cover:
- Architecture decisions
- API patterns
- Database schemas
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures
- Third-party integrations

**Consider creating references for**:

| Reference | When to Create |
|-----------|----------------|
| `architecture.md` | Complex system design |
| `api-patterns.md` | REST/GraphQL conventions |
| `database.md` | Schema, migrations, queries |
| `testing.md` | Test patterns and coverage |
| `deployment.md` | CI/CD and infrastructure |
| `security.md` | Auth, secrets, vulnerabilities |
| `[technology].md` | Specific tech deep-dives |

**Reference checklist**:
- [ ] Identify knowledge that agents frequently need
- [ ] Create focused reference docs (one topic per file)
- [ ] Include code examples from your actual codebase
- [ ] Document gotchas and common mistakes
- [ ] Link from AGENTS.md and relevant personas

### Phase 5: Build Custom Skills

**Goal**: Create executable, repeatable functionality.

Use `/skill skill-creator` to create skills for tasks that:
- Are performed repeatedly
- Have consistent steps
- Benefit from automation
- Need to be shared across the team

**Consider creating skills for**:

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `component-creator` | Generate new components with tests |
| `api-endpoint` | Scaffold new API endpoints |
| `migration-creator` | Create database migrations |
| `test-generator` | Generate test scaffolds |
| `release-notes` | Generate changelogs |

**Skill checklist**:
- [ ] Identify repetitive tasks that follow patterns
- [ ] Create skills using `/skill skill-creator`
- [ ] Include validation and error handling
- [ ] Document usage with examples
- [ ] Symlinks auto-created in `.claude/skills/`

### Phase 6: Create Implementation Plans

**Goal**: Use `agents/plans/` for tracking work with embedded task checklists.

- [ ] Review plans created by workspace-builder
- [ ] Create new plans using `/skill plan-creator`
- [ ] Each plan contains its own task checklist

## Maintenance

### Periodic Updates

Run `npx workspace-agents` periodically to:
- Sync new skills from the framework
- Fix broken symlinks
- Update directory structure

### Documentation Freshness

Invoke the documentation-agent when:
- Adding new features
- Changing architecture
- Updating dependencies
- Onboarding new team members

```
@documentation-agent Review and update our agent documentation
```

### Evolving Your Workspace

As your project grows:
1. **Add personas** for new domains of expertise
2. **Create skills** for new repeatable tasks
3. **Update references** when patterns change
4. **Keep AGENTS.md current** with major changes

## Summary Checklist

### Essential (Do First)
- [ ] Run `@workspace-builder enhance my workspace`
- [ ] Review and refine AGENTS.md
- [ ] Commit customized files

### Recommended (Do Soon)
- [ ] Create development-agent.md (if not auto-created)
- [ ] Add 1-2 project-specific reference docs
- [ ] Review improvement plans created by workspace-builder

### Optional (Do As Needed)
- [ ] Create domain-specific personas
- [ ] Build custom skills for repetitive tasks
- [ ] Set up complex feature plans
