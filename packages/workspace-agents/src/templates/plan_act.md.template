# Plan → Act → Test Workflow

Complete workflow guide for AI-assisted development in {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

## Overview

The Plan → Act → Test workflow provides structure for feature development while maintaining code quality and preventing rework.

```
┌─────────┐
│  PLAN   │ → Understand requirements, explore code, create implementation plan
└────┬────┘
     │
┌────▼────┐
│   ACT   │ → Implement incrementally, commit often, follow patterns
└────┬────┘
     │
┌────▼────┐
│  TEST   │ → Verify correctness, run tests, update docs, create PR
└─────────┘
```

## Plan Phase

1. **Understand requirements** - What problem are we solving?
2. **Explore codebase** - How is similar functionality implemented?
3. **Ask questions** - Resolve ambiguity before coding
4. **Create plan** - Use `/skill plan-creator` for structured plans
5. **Define tests** - How will we verify success?

## Act Phase

1. **Create branch** - `git checkout -b feature/description`
2. **Implement incrementally** - One task at a time
3. **Commit often** - Small, focused commits
4. **Test continuously** - Verify as you go
5. **Update plan** - Check off completed tasks

## Test Phase

1. **Run tests** - Full test suite passes
2. **Manual testing** - Verify end-to-end
3. **Update docs** - Keep documentation current
4. **Code review** - Request review if needed
5. **Mark complete** - Update task status

## Plan Storage

- **`agents/plans/`** - Committed plans for multi-session work
- **`agents/plans/local/`** - Gitignored scratch work, session notes

## Creating Plans

Use the plan-creator skill:

```bash
/skill plan-creator
```

This provides templates for:
- **Feature plans** - New functionality
- **Bug fix plans** - Defect resolution
- **Refactor plans** - Code restructuring

See `agents/skills/plan-creator/SKILL.md` for complete documentation.

## Best Practices

- **Plan first** for non-trivial work
- **Commit often** with clear messages
- **Test continuously** to catch issues early
- **Ask questions** before making assumptions
- **Update documentation** as you go
