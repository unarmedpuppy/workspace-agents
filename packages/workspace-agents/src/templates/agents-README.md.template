## Reference Documentation

Topic-focused guides for specific patterns and practices:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `agent-patterns.md` | Best practices for AI agent workflows |
| `documentation-style.md` | Markdown and documentation standards |
| `plan_act.md` | Plan → Act → Test workflow guide |
| `skill-patterns.md` | Skill design and implementation patterns |
| `coding-style-guide.md` | Project coding standards and conventions |

## Plans

Implementation plans with embedded task checklists. Use `/skill plan-creator` to create new plans.

### Committed Plans (`plans/`)

Multi-session implementation plans that are shared across the team. Each plan contains its own task checklist.

### Local Plans (`plans/local/`)

Gitignored scratch work for exploratory analysis and session notes.

## Personas

Reusable agent personalities that provide contextual guidance:

- `documentation-agent.md` - Maintains documentation quality
- `framework-agent.md` - Framework development patterns
- `meta-agent.md` - Meta-level project guidance

Create project-specific personas as needed.

## Skills

Executable, deterministic skills following Anthropic standards:

- Each skill has `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter
- `scripts/` contains implementation
- `references/` has detailed documentation
- See `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code integration

## Legacy

Archive for deprecated patterns and migration artifacts.
